DNSRecon is a DNS scanning and enumeration tool written in Python, which allows you to perform different tasks, such as enumeration of standard records for a defined domain (A, NS, SOA, and MX). Top-level domain expansion for a defined domain.

With this graph-oriented user interface, the different records of a specific domain can be observed, classified and ordered in a simple way.
